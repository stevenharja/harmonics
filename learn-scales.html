										<p>Musical scales are known by many to be the fundamentals basics that must be done before learning any instruments.
											Whether you are learning that hard rock solo on your electric guitar or working on passages of classical pieces on your violin, scales are always mentioned.
											Although some people might find scale or specifically musical theories to be scary or hard to learn, understanding them will help improve your musicality for your instruments, and even other future instruments that you may want to learn.
										</p>
										<p>Scales are mainly broken down into major and minor scales, where they are most commonly used by all musician across all levels. Each notes (from A-G) acts as a <strong>key</strong>.
										The key acts as the starting note and acts as a "home" for the scale.
										Another important thing to know about scales is to understand what chords fits in what key, or what chords belongs to a scale, so if someone asks
										you to play a song in C major, you will know that the chord that creates the C major scale would be.
										For example, if you play a C major scale, then the chords that fits with the scale are C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim. To understand how we know whether the chord is a major or a minor is based on 
										<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_Number_System">Nashville Numbering System</a>.
