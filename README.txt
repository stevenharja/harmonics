Harmonics is a project that was developed to help musicians generate simple melody lines and to be able to explore and try out new notes that they might not be comfortable with yet and improve on them.

It also features a fully pure javascript that will show the top posts of reddit, based on the specific subreddit and utilising JSON files as the source data.
